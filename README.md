# Environment Details:
This section contains general information about the environment where Bonita is used. More information is included in the final Zip file, but only the most relevant ones are displayed on the page.

# Log Files:
This section contains log files that the user could select so they will be added in the final Zip file.

# Setup Configuration:
This section performs a "setup.sh/bat" of the configuration files and prepares these files so they'll be included in the final Zip file that users can download. Users have to perform a pull in order to include configuration files. Otherwise, only log files and environment details in the result Zip file.

# Download Files:
As its name indicates, this button is responsible for downloading the files that are important to troubleshoot issues on the product.
